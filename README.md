## The Central Problem 
Coronary Heart Disease presents a major healthcare burden across the world, as it is the leading cause of mortality in the United States and third worldwide. According to the NIH, CHD accounts for roughly 25%, or 610,000 annual deaths in the US and 17.8 million annual deaths globally.

## Problem Statement
The SCRAPE–LNP aims to treat adults with CHD in a cost-effective, time-efficient, and non-invasive manner while minimizing vessel damage and restoring blood flow.

## Design Overview
The Size-Conforming Rotational Arterial Plaque Eliminator – Lipid Nanoparticles (SCRAPE-LNP) combines radial catheterization, a plaque removal device, a downstream filter, and the addition of a modified stent (see Appendix A). To remove plaque, a flexible blade travels along a helically-threaded guidewire by rotating along its threads. The blade’s flexibility allows it to uniquely conform to the width of the artery, allowing for optimal plaque removal and minimal damage to the artery walls as compared to existing solutions. As plaque is cut, it is contained within the device’s mesh body. There is also a filter that operates with a modified umbrella mechanism downstream of the blade, contributing to a bilateral filtration system for the plaque removal apparatus. After the plaque removal stage is complete, an expandable, silicone-coated stent is placed into the artery. Within nanopores on the silicone surface, there are lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) filled with mRNA encoding for endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), an enzyme that generates the vasoprotective molecule nitric oxide. This vasodilator mitigates the thrombosis and restenosis associated with existing stents.

## Plaque Removal
The plaque removal mechanism consists of 4 parts: a helical blade, an internally-threaded body, an externally-threaded guide catheter, and a standard guidewire. The blade is made of medical grade 18-8 stainless steel, which is flexible and biocompatible.18,19 It is helically-shaped and flexible, allowing it to coil and uncoil to conform to any vessel diameter. The blade has a maximum diameter of 5.0 mm, which is equal to the maximum diameter of a coronary artery, assuming the patient does not suffer from left ventricular hypertrophy or dilated cardiomyopathy.20 A pitch of 1.27 mm at this maximum diameter was chosen because it creates a 5:1 ratio between the pitch of the blade and the pitch of the threads surrounding the body. This allows for the surgeon to more easily control the speed of the blade, as the blade will rotate 5 times slower than the body. The arc length of the blade was chosen to be 52.5 mm, as this would result in one full coil of the blade when it is conformed to the maximum artery diameter of 5.0 mm (see Appendix D). The edge of the blade in contact with the vessel wall is blunt and coated with a thin layer of biocompatible non-corrosive silicone to prevent artery wall lacerations.21 The blade has a surface continuously facing the plaque that is 0.20 mm wide. Protruding off of this surface, medical grade 18-8 stainless steel serrations lacerate the plaque as the blade rotates. A surface width of 0.20 mm was determined by using an average artery blockage of 75% and an average coronary artery diameter of 2.78 mm to find that the plaque would jut out 1.18 mm off of the artery wall, assuming the plaque is evenly distributed along the artery wall (see Appendix E).22,23 Therefore, a 0.20 mm blade surface will contact 17% of the plaque that is closest to the artery wall, thus efficiently cutting the plaque off the artery wall and breaking it apart into smaller pieces. This helical shape, paired with the rotation of the blade, allows for a precise 360° cut along the vessel wall that will occur in one continuous motion.

The second component in plaque removal, the cylindrical body attached to the blade, is hollow and 2.22 mm in diameter. 2.22 mm was chosen, as it creates a 0.8 burr to artery diameter ratio (assuming an average coronary artery diameter of 2.78 mm).23,24 The body length is 15 mm, based on the standard balloon length for cutting balloon angioplasty.25 The lateral surface of the body is a polylactic acid (PLA) 110-micron-pore filter, similar to existing filters, that stores the plaque without impeding blood flow.26 The body’s inner diameter is 1.82 mm, which allows it to house plaque cut by the blade while not interfering with the catheter. On the surface opposite the blade, the body contains a mesh stop internally-threaded with female screw threads that allows the body and blade to move rotationally along the externally-threaded catheter. An external compressed gas motor, which is standard for rotational atherectomy, attaches to the body, thus facilitating its rotational motion.27 This, in turn, guides the attached blade to rotate and cut plaque.
The guidewire is a standard guidewire for balloon angioplasty and will have a diameter of 0.0356 mm.28 The guide catheter is a standard “child-mother” system that encases the guidewire and has an outer diameter of 1.32 mm (4 F).28 It is composed of an inner teflon layer, a stainless steel braidwire core, and a nylon outer layer, which is standard for balloon angioplasty catheters.28 The nylon outer layer is externally-threaded with 18-8 stainless steel male screw threads that have a 0.254 mm pitch, a thread angle of 60°, and a thread depth of 0.0889 mm. These dimensions create spaces between each thread, thus maintaining the flexibility of the guide catheter. The guide catheter’s male screw threads interface with the female screw threads of the body, allowing the device to traverse the vessel in a lateral and rotational motion.

The difference between our solution and existing atherectomy procedures is that our solution has a flexible helical blade, an externally-threaded guidewire, and an internally-threaded body. These attributes offer three key advantages: less damage to the vessel walls during the procedure, more precise plaque removal, and greater time-efficiency. Current atherectomy procedures risk abrasions on the vessel walls due to imprecise use of the device. Our design mitigates this by implementing a flexible blade and silicone outer sheath that protects against tissue lacerations. The helically-shaped blade along with the screw guidewire allows for a much closer cut to the vessel wall by coiling and uncoiling to conform to the artery diameter. It will also remove plaque in one continuous motion, unlike balloon angioplasty, which significantly reduces the procedure time. Moreover, the cylindrical body acts as a storage unit for cut plaque, preventing plaque and atheromatous debris from remaining in the bloodstream. This reduces the harmful effects of distal embolization characteristic of standard atherectomy procedures.


## Airflow Testing
Since we did not use real UV-C light, we conducted airflow testing to make sure that air is circulating well throughout the device. To do this, we measured the air being directed into the chamber and the air being directed out the other chamber. Data was collected with an airflow probe, and we placed this airflow probe over the openings of each of the chambers in the back at the same distance. We placed the probe in front of the inhale chamber for about 20 seconds until it had a steady reading, then did the same for the exhale chamber.

We ran 3 trials of this test and our results are shown below in Table 1. Our probe measured the flow rate in and flow rate out in cubed feet per meter. The flow rate in represents the air going into the chamber, while the flow rate out is the flow rate going out the other chamber. We were then able to calculate the volume of air collected in 1 min by making the necessary conversion, which was multiplying the flow rate by about 28. The target value we were trying to achieve is a volume of 6 L/min for both the air going in and the air going out, because that it the average volume that an adult breathes in and out in one minute. As you can see from Table 1 below, all 3 of our trials passed this test.

## Audibility Testing
We conducted audibility testing to measure how much the device affects audibility. For our testing procedure, we first recorded ourselves saying “UltraVisor-C” using voice memos. We played the recording and measured the decibel level it reached using an online decibel meter. Then, we measured the decibel level while a team member wore the device and played the voice memo from inside the visor. Since N95 masks have been proven to reduce speech audibility by about 2.7 decibels, the target value of reduction for each recording is ≤ 2.7 decibels. We conducted 3 trials of this process, and the data is shown below in Table 2. We calculated the average of all 3 trials and then calculated the difference. There was only a 1.867 dB reduction between wearing the device versus speaking normally, so our prototype passed this test.

## Safety and Battery Life


## Limitations and Feasbility
While SCRAPE-LNP offers numerous advantages compared to existing solutions, it also has some limitations that need to be acknowledged. The use of novel technologies such as the size-conforming blade, downstream filter, and rotating body prevent the determination of overall feasibility. The mechanisms of each component must be experimentally tested in order to ensure that the device can function as a single, cohesive unit without harmful complications.
Both the lateral and rotational velocities of the blade must be determined, since they are directly related to thermal damage of the artery. An optimal velocity for removing plaque while limiting thermal damage can be determined by testing different velocities with an artificial artery model. Since we have no similar reference, the rotational velocity of the blade must be determined experimentally. Once the optimal blade velocity is found with which the blade effectively breaks apart the plaque without causing thermal damage to the artery, the rotational velocity of the body can easily be found by using a 5 to 1 ratio, which is the ratio of the pitches of the blade and body (1.27 mm and 0.254 mm, respectively). The linear velocity of the body can also be determined from the rotational velocity, since it moves 0.254 mm laterally for every rotation. This value was also determined from the body screw thread pitch of 0.254 mm. Since the body of the device is rigid and does not conform to the diameter of the artery wall in the way the helical blade does, there is a chance that the plaque that is cut may fall through the space between the vessel wall and cylindrical body. Due to the rotational motion of the blade, we assumed that the cut plaque will be swept by the blade radially inward and that plaque moving in other directions is extremely unlikely, which prevents it from leaving the plaque removal system. If future testing reveals that plaque escapes through the gap between the device body and artery wall, then another upstream filter will be implemented on the surface of the body opposite to the blade in order to capture excess plaque.
In addition, while research suggests the possibility of drug loading on the silicone rubber membrane and adsorption of phospholipids on silicone particles,39 a clear mechanism that stabilizes the interaction between the silicone pores and lipid nanoparticles needs to be defined. As suggested in the previous section, a covalent attachment with PEG linker is one possibility, as PEG is also a part of the outer membrane of the lipid nanoparticles. However, other methods such as oxidation and electrostatic adsorption should be analyzed as well while testing the surface chemistry.40 Additional experimental variables include the pore size, the number of pores, and the concentration of LNPs in each pore. These quantities determine the drug release rate and must be established experimentally. Another limitation is the cost of the device. One of the design goals for SCRAPE–LNP was to reduce the cost in order to make the device more financially accessible. However, it is unclear if the cost of the device will be less than the set target value of $9,345 (see Table 1),13 mainly because the manufacturing process of LNPs is very expensive.56 Furthermore, while our device is expected to reduce distal embolization and increase plaque removal relative to existing solutions, the lingering risk of thrombosis and restenosis cannot be overlooked, since the plaque cannot be completely removed, and a stent remains in the artery post-procedure.

## Future Work
For future teams that plan on continuing this project, we hope that our prototype's current limitations can be addressed. First, to address the issue of muffled speech, a microphone speaker system could possibly be implemented in the device. Second, for issues regarding adjustability, different visor sizes could be made for individuals who have larger or smaller head sizes. Lastly, to address the issue of comfortability and dropping battery voltage, a smaller, rechargeable battery could be used to reduce weight on top of the user's head. 

The modified CAD files we created are added to this post, as well as photos of our prototypes.
