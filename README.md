## The Central Problem 
Coronary Heart Disease presents a major healthcare burden across the world, as it is the leading cause of mortality in the United States and third worldwide. According to the NIH, CHD accounts for roughly 25%, or 610,000 annual deaths in the US and 17.8 million annual deaths globally. Currently, the predominant non-prescription methods used to treat CHD (i.e. cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, angioplasty, and atherectomy) present many limitations. In coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, complications due to the procedure contribute to inflammation and tissue damage that lead to postoperative morbidity and mortality.4 Postoperative cognitive impairment is common,4 and the highly invasive nature of bypass surgeries can lead to infections. Angioplasties are associated with risks of vessel dissection and ischemic complications.5 Limitations with directional atherectomies include the embolization of atheromatous debris, resulting in small myocardial infarctions.5 Rotational atherectomy results in a higher rate of major ischemic complications or repeated revascularization.5 

## Problem Statement
The SCRAPE–LNP aims to treat adults with CHD in a cost-effective, time-efficient, and non-invasive manner while minimizing vessel damage and restoring blood flow.

## Design Overview
The Size-Conforming Rotational Arterial Plaque Eliminator – Lipid Nanoparticles (SCRAPE-LNP) combines radial catheterization, a plaque removal device, a downstream filter, and the addition of a modified stent. To remove plaque, a flexible blade travels along a helically-threaded guidewire by rotating along its threads. The blade’s flexibility allows it to uniquely conform to the width of the artery, allowing for optimal plaque removal and minimal damage to the artery walls as compared to existing solutions. As plaque is cut, it is contained within the device’s mesh body. There is also a filter that operates with a modified umbrella mechanism downstream of the blade, contributing to a bilateral filtration system for the plaque removal apparatus. After the plaque removal stage is complete, an expandable, silicone-coated stent is placed into the artery. Within nanopores on the silicone surface, there are lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) filled with mRNA encoding for endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), an enzyme that generates the vasoprotective molecule nitric oxide. This vasodilator mitigates the thrombosis and restenosis associated with existing stents.

## Plaque Removal
The plaque removal mechanism consists of 4 parts: a helical blade, an internally-threaded body, an externally-threaded guide catheter, and a standard guidewire. The blade is made of medical grade 18-8 stainless steel, which is flexible and biocompatible.18,19 It is helically-shaped and flexible, allowing it to coil and uncoil to conform to any vessel diameter. The blade has a maximum diameter of 5.0 mm, which is equal to the maximum diameter of a coronary artery, assuming the patient does not suffer from left ventricular hypertrophy or dilated cardiomyopathy.20 A pitch of 1.27 mm at this maximum diameter was chosen because it creates a 5:1 ratio between the pitch of the blade and the pitch of the threads surrounding the body. This allows for the surgeon to more easily control the speed of the blade, as the blade will rotate 5 times slower than the body. The arc length of the blade was chosen to be 52.5 mm, as this would result in one full coil of the blade when it is conformed to the maximum artery diameter of 5.0 mm (see Appendix D). The edge of the blade in contact with the vessel wall is blunt and coated with a thin layer of biocompatible non-corrosive silicone to prevent artery wall lacerations.21 The blade has a surface continuously facing the plaque that is 0.20 mm wide. Protruding off of this surface, medical grade 18-8 stainless steel serrations lacerate the plaque as the blade rotates. A surface width of 0.20 mm was determined by using an average artery blockage of 75% and an average coronary artery diameter of 2.78 mm to find that the plaque would jut out 1.18 mm off of the artery wall, assuming the plaque is evenly distributed along the artery wall (see Appendix E).22,23 Therefore, a 0.20 mm blade surface will contact 17% of the plaque that is closest to the artery wall, thus efficiently cutting the plaque off the artery wall and breaking it apart into smaller pieces. This helical shape, paired with the rotation of the blade, allows for a precise 360° cut along the vessel wall that will occur in one continuous motion.

<img width="800" alt="blade" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104453485/196784287-30b9dee5-6aee-4cf2-b8ee-cd5a35cd5546.png">

The second component in plaque removal, the cylindrical body attached to the blade, is hollow and 2.22 mm in diameter. 2.22 mm was chosen, as it creates a 0.8 burr to artery diameter ratio (assuming an average coronary artery diameter of 2.78 mm).23,24 The body length is 15 mm, based on the standard balloon length for cutting balloon angioplasty.25 The lateral surface of the body is a polylactic acid (PLA) 110-micron-pore filter, similar to existing filters, that stores the plaque without impeding blood flow.26 The body’s inner diameter is 1.82 mm, which allows it to house plaque cut by the blade while not interfering with the catheter. On the surface opposite the blade, the body contains a mesh stop internally-threaded with female screw threads that allows the body and blade to move rotationally along the externally-threaded catheter. An external compressed gas motor, which is standard for rotational atherectomy, attaches to the body, thus facilitating its rotational motion.27 This, in turn, guides the attached blade to rotate and cut plaque.

The guidewire is a standard guidewire for balloon angioplasty and will have a diameter of 0.0356 mm.28 The guide catheter is a standard “child-mother” system that encases the guidewire and has an outer diameter of 1.32 mm (4 F).28 It is composed of an inner teflon layer, a stainless steel braidwire core, and a nylon outer layer, which is standard for balloon angioplasty catheters.28 The nylon outer layer is externally-threaded with 18-8 stainless steel male screw threads that have a 0.254 mm pitch, a thread angle of 60°, and a thread depth of 0.0889 mm. These dimensions create spaces between each thread, thus maintaining the flexibility of the guide catheter. The guide catheter’s male screw threads interface with the female screw threads of the body, allowing the device to traverse the vessel in a lateral and rotational motion.

<img width="800" alt="rotational motion" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104453485/196786340-5fa09953-8b06-46f8-b4a8-803a96a1f377.mp4">

The difference between our solution and existing atherectomy procedures is that our solution has a flexible helical blade, an externally-threaded guidewire, and an internally-threaded body. These attributes offer three key advantages: less damage to the vessel walls during the procedure, more precise plaque removal, and greater time-efficiency. Current atherectomy procedures risk abrasions on the vessel walls due to imprecise use of the device. Our design mitigates this by implementing a flexible blade and silicone outer sheath that protects against tissue lacerations. The helically-shaped blade along with the screw guidewire allows for a much closer cut to the vessel wall by coiling and uncoiling to conform to the artery diameter. It will also remove plaque in one continuous motion, unlike balloon angioplasty, which significantly reduces the procedure time. Moreover, the cylindrical body acts as a storage unit for cut plaque, preventing plaque and atheromatous debris from remaining in the bloodstream. This reduces the harmful effects of distal embolization characteristic of standard atherectomy procedures.

## Downstream Filter
To further prevent distal embolization, another filter is placed between the blade and the angioplasty balloon (see Appendix F). The filter is circular with a diameter of 5.32 mm and can bend to take on the shape of an umbrella canopy, conforming to the diameter of any coronary artery up to our assumed maximum diameter of 5.0 mm.20 The filter is made of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), which is biocompatible, ductile, and flexible.30 Like the body of the plaque removal device, it is a uniform 110-micron-pore filter designed to permit continuous blood flow while maintaining embolic capture efficiency.31 The catheter runs through the center of the filter, which is made possible by the helical configuration of the blade, allowing the catheter to extend beyond it.

The filter employs a modified “umbrella mechanism”. The filter acts as the canopy of the umbrella, which is concave towards the blade. Ribs made of a polylactic acid composite, which is biodegradable, rigid, and malleable, are pivotally attached to the filter. Each rib has a length of 2 mm, spanning the length from the edge of the filter to the catheter.28,31 A total of 8 ribs will be attached to the filter canopy to resemble the structure and function of everyday umbrellas. A hollow cylindrical runner made of biocompatible 18-8 stainless steel surrounds the catheter.19 It contains female screw threads that interface with male screw threads on the nylon layer of the catheter. These male and female screw threads are identical to those that allow the plaque removal device to traverse the artery. The runner has an inner diameter of 1.32 mm (equal to that of the catheter) and an outer diameter of 1.34 mm so that it is wide enough to be durable and contain female screw threads.28 It also has a length of 2.54 mm so that the screw threads (with a pitch of 0.254 mm) can revolve 10 times within the body of the runner; as such, one thread can break without affecting the motion of the runner along the catheter, making the device more durable. The outer edges of the ribs of the filter are connected to the outer diameter of the runner with stretchers made of flexible TPU. The stretchers each have a length 3.98 mm, which is equal to the radius of the filter canopy minus the outer radius of the runner. As such, the runner and the filter are in direct contact when the filter is fully expanded.
The filter canopy is initially “closed” when the catheter is first inserted into the artery, as the stretchers pull and bend the ribs towards the catheter. Due to the rigidity of the PLA composite ribs, their bent state creates tension. In this state, the runner is 5.98 mm away from the pivot of the filter, which is equal to the sum of the lengths of the ribs and the stretchers.

Before the blade starts rotating, the filter canopy is “opened” by rotating the runner with an external compressed gas motor which is identical to but separate from the motor that controls the rotation of the body of the plaque removal device. This moves the runner along the male threads towards the filter, reducing the tension in the ribs and allowing them to uncurl and expand the filter canopy. The canopy, having a diameter greater than that of the artery, does not expand fully as the artery walls stop its expansion and maintain its “umbrella” conformation. As such, the filter covers the entire cross-sectional area of the artery lumen, capturing any embolisms without obstructing blood flow. If the filter fully expands, the runner will come in contact with the filter and the plaque buildup on it; in this state, it is assumed that the plaque will have no effect on the rotation of the runner.

After the blade stops rotating, the filter canopy can be partially closed by rotating the runner in the opposite direction. This reduces the diameter of the filter so that it can move through any larger artery or bifurcation without the risk of losing some of the captured plaque to the blood. The closed conformation also allows the filter to move through any smaller artery without agitating the artery walls.

While there are existing solutions that attempt to prevent distal embolization, these solutions have a number of limitations. Embolization in side branches proximal to the filter might not be prevented.33 Moreover, existing distal filters are reported for common modes of failure such as detachment and/or damage of the device components, device entrapment, and stent-related issues.34 Our umbrella filter evades these problems by conforming to any coronary artery diameter and subsequently closing in on the plaque, thus preventing bypass of the plaque. Our filter will also remain attached to the catheter, thus avoiding modes of failure associated with distal filters that are not secured to the catheter.

## Silicone Stent
Following the plaque removal procedure, an expandable silicone-coated metal stent is placed into the patient’s artery. The stent is placed in the artery via a traditional balloon catheter attached to the guidewire and located directly in front of the filter canopy.5,15 As the rest of the SCRAPE–LNP apparatus is removed from the artery, the stent is finally expanded by inflating the balloon at the target location. Once the stent is secured in place, the guidewire subsequently directs the catheter and the entire device body to exit the artery before the sheath is removed.

When fully expanded, the cylindrical stent is 24 mm long and has a diameter between 2.25-4 mm, based on the dimensions of an existing product that acquired FDA-approval.35 This maintains the expanded diameter of the artery that has been cleared of plaque. Given that the magnesium alloy used in silicon-coated stents provides poor structural support, a stainless steel stent is implemented for better biocompatibility and mechanical support.36,37 A nanopore-embedded silicone rubber membrane is wrapped around the mesh of the stent in order to mitigate inflammation caused by interaction between the artery walls and the stent in typical angioplasty procedures.36 Ideally, the length of the silicone membrane should be the same as the length of the cylindrical stent. It is assumed in our stent design process that the clinical results of implementing a silicone rubber membrane stent in a rabbit-esophageal model will successfully translate to the human-artery system. The stainless steel stent will maintain its expandable structure even with a silicone membrane, which is applied to the stent via the “dipping and spinning method” to ensure full coverage.36 The pores on the membrane can be created by a dry-cast technique, which uses a liquid paraffin (LP) phase that is removed after the silicone rubber membrane has been cured.38 The pore size can be controlled with the concentration of LP and different casting conditions.38 It is expected that LNPs can be loaded into silicone pores, based on the stable adsorption of phospholipids by porous silicone particles.39 The LNPs can be loaded into the silicone pores via a polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker, which is covalently bonded to the surface of the silicone pores. This mechanism locks the LNPs inside the pores, and the LNPs are released only when the bonds between the membrane surface and the PEG linker are broken.40 Once the stent is placed, the LNPs are released over a period of several weeks.40

Second generation drug-eluting stents (DES) that are currently being implemented have multiple limitations. These include side effects from the drugs and inflammation caused by the interaction between the stent mesh and the artery walls. The drugs that prevent restenosis additionally impede re-endothelialization of the artery walls, which leads to chronic inflammation.41 However, by creating a barrier between the artery and the stent with a silicone membrane, the SCRAPE–LNP stent will improve the rate of endothelialization, resulting in a faster postoperative recovery. As demonstrated in Kai Yang et. al’s rabbit model, when the silicone-coated stent was placed, the esophageal wall was reconstructed successfully without inducing severe injury.36 With LNPs that are released from the silicone pores, the device will prevent the major risk of thrombosis and late stent restenosis. 


## Lipid Nanoparticles
Within the pores of the stent are lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) containing the sequence of mRNA that encodes endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), an enzyme that converts the amino acid L-arginine to the vasoprotective molecule nitric oxide (NO).42 The LNPs are made of cationic lipids because the positive charge on cationic lipids spontaneously encapsulates negatively-charged mRNA (see Appendix G).43  The cationic lipid 1,2-di-O-octadecenyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTMA) is used because it has a higher transfection rate in vivo compared to the other most commonly used cationic lipid, DOTAP.44 Interspaced between the cationic lipids are helper lipids, such as dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), which promote the endosomal release of the mRNA.45 Cholesterol serves a similar purpose, stabilizing the LNP by filling in gaps between phospholipids.45 Lastly, the LNPs contain polyethylene glycol (PEG)-functionalized lipids.46 PEGylated lipids improve particle stability, delivery efficacy, tolerability, and biodistribution.46 Additionally, PEGylated lipids reduce phagocytosis, as PEGylated lipids are less likely to be recognized as foreign particles by macrophages.47 The LNPs enter the endothelial cells via endocytosis.43,46 This process is electrostatically favorable, as the cell membrane is negatively charged, and the cationic lipids of the LNP are positively charged. Once inside the cell, the ribosomes translate the mRNA into the proteins that form eNOS.

NO is important for endothelial cell health. NO acts to down-regulate platelet aggregation and adherence, and thus plays an important role in preventing thrombosis,48 a potentially life-threatening complication of metal stents. Additionally, evidence suggests that NO has the ability to prevent the ability of plaque formation,48 unlike the drugs used in drug-eluting stents. Specifically, NO achieves anti-proliferation, anti-migration, and re-endothelialization,49,50 of which most drugs are unable to accomplish on their own. Additionally, drug combination may lead to adverse effects,51,52 such as increased cardiac events and vessel failure as a result of the combination of glycoprotein IIbIIIa inhibitors with paclitaxel drug-eluting stents.53 Drug-eluting stents also require the use of blood thinners for at least a year.52 Blood thinners increase the risk of major bleeding,54 and patients on blood thinners are encouraged to take precautions handling sharp objects and to avoid activities and sports that could cause injury.55 NO has the same anticoagulation properties as blood thinners without requiring patients to alter their lifestyles. While it cannot be guaranteed that the NO will eradicate the need for blood thinners, patients are expected to be able to either take a lesser dosage of blood thinners or take the blood thinners for a shorter period of time. Current drug-eluting stents also use polymers, which can cause late-stent thrombosis and restenosis,56 but are avoidable through the use of NO and a silicone membrane.

## Specifications of Device Components

## Limitations and Future Work
While SCRAPE-LNP offers numerous advantages compared to existing solutions, it also has some limitations that need to be acknowledged. The use of novel technologies such as the size-conforming blade, downstream filter, and rotating body prevent the determination of overall feasibility. The mechanisms of each component must be experimentally tested in order to ensure that the device can function as a single, cohesive unit without harmful complications.
Both the lateral and rotational velocities of the blade must be determined, since they are directly related to thermal damage of the artery. An optimal velocity for removing plaque while limiting thermal damage can be determined by testing different velocities with an artificial artery model. Since we have no similar reference, the rotational velocity of the blade must be determined experimentally. Once the optimal blade velocity is found with which the blade effectively breaks apart the plaque without causing thermal damage to the artery, the rotational velocity of the body can easily be found by using a 5 to 1 ratio, which is the ratio of the pitches of the blade and body (1.27 mm and 0.254 mm, respectively). The linear velocity of the body can also be determined from the rotational velocity, since it moves 0.254 mm laterally for every rotation. This value was also determined from the body screw thread pitch of 0.254 mm. Since the body of the device is rigid and does not conform to the diameter of the artery wall in the way the helical blade does, there is a chance that the plaque that is cut may fall through the space between the vessel wall and cylindrical body. Due to the rotational motion of the blade, we assumed that the cut plaque will be swept by the blade radially inward and that plaque moving in other directions is extremely unlikely, which prevents it from leaving the plaque removal system. If future testing reveals that plaque escapes through the gap between the device body and artery wall, then another upstream filter will be implemented on the surface of the body opposite to the blade in order to capture excess plaque.

In addition, while research suggests the possibility of drug loading on the silicone rubber membrane and adsorption of phospholipids on silicone particles,39 a clear mechanism that stabilizes the interaction between the silicone pores and lipid nanoparticles needs to be defined. As suggested in the previous section, a covalent attachment with PEG linker is one possibility, as PEG is also a part of the outer membrane of the lipid nanoparticles. However, other methods such as oxidation and electrostatic adsorption should be analyzed as well while testing the surface chemistry.40 Additional experimental variables include the pore size, the number of pores, and the concentration of LNPs in each pore. These quantities determine the drug release rate and must be established experimentally. Another limitation is the cost of the device. One of the design goals for SCRAPE–LNP was to reduce the cost in order to make the device more financially accessible. However, it is unclear if the cost of the device will be less than the set target value of $9,345 (see Table 1),13 mainly because the manufacturing process of LNPs is very expensive.56 Furthermore, while our device is expected to reduce distal embolization and increase plaque removal relative to existing solutions, the lingering risk of thrombosis and restenosis cannot be overlooked, since the plaque cannot be completely removed, and a stent remains in the artery post-procedure.
